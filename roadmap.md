Okay, here's a breakdown of a tech stack and a step-by-step guide for building your app. I'll focus on a cross-platform approach for maximum reach and efficiency.

Ultimate Tech Stack
Here's a recommended tech stack for a balance of performance, scalability, and development speed:

Frontend:
React Native:

Why: Enables building native mobile apps for both iOS and Android using a single JavaScript codebase. Large community, extensive libraries, and great performance.

Alternatives: Flutter (Dart), Ionic (Angular/React/Vue with Capacitor)

UI Library:

React Native Paper or NativeBase: Provide pre-built, customizable UI components to speed up development.

Backend:
Node.js with Express.js:

Why: Efficient, scalable, and uses JavaScript (matching the frontend language), simplifying development.

Alternatives: Python (Django/Flask), Ruby on Rails, Go

Authentication:

Firebase Authentication or Auth0: Provides secure user registration, login, and user management with social login options if desired.

Alternatively: you can build your own authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Database:
Cloud Storage:

Firebase Storage or AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage

Why: These are cloud storage services, this is great because it makes it easy to store and retrieve the video files (the bulk of your app's data). You will need to use the chosen cloud's SDK in order to interact with the database.

Alternatives: You can also explore setting up your own server and manage the storage yourself, but this would require more work and would cost more, as you would have to pay for the server space.

NoSQL Database:

MongoDB or Firebase Firestore:

Why: NoSQL databases are ideal for storing unstructured data like user profiles, notification settings, app usage data, etc. MongoDB is highly flexible and scalable. Firestore is a fully managed, serverless NoSQL database that is part of Firebase.

Alternatives: PostgreSQL (with JSONB support), Couchbase

Other Tools:
Version Control: Git (with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

Cloud Platform: AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure - choose one for hosting the backend, database, and potential future services.

Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or OneSignal

Error Tracking: Sentry, Bugsnag

Step-by-Step Development Guide
Here's a simplified guide, building your app modularly:

Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure (2-3 weeks)
Environment Setup:

Install Node.js, npm (or yarn), and the React Native CLI.

Create a new React Native project: npx react-native init YourAppName

Set up a Git repository for version control.

Backend Initialization:

Create a backend folder within your project.

Initialize a Node.js project: npm init -y

Install Express: npm install express

Create a basic Express server (index.js) to test the setup.

Folder Structure:

Organize your frontend code with a clear structure:

YourAppName/
├── android/       
├── ios/           
├── src/          
│   ├── components/
│   ├── screens/
│   ├── navigation/
│   ├── services/  
│   ├── utils/    
│   └── App.js     
└── backend/      
    └── index.js
Use code with caution.
Navigation:

Install React Navigation: npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack

Set up basic navigation with a StackNavigator for the main screens (e.g., Home, Playback, Settings).

UI Components:

Install a UI library like React Native Paper or NativeBase.

Create reusable UI components (Buttons, TextInputs, Cards, etc.) in the components folder.

Connect the Front End and Back End

Create a simple API endpoint on your Express server (e.g., /api/test).

Use the fetch API or a library like axios in your React Native app to make a request to the endpoint and display the response.

Legal Warning and Permissions Setup (Add this as first priority):

1. Create a Legal Warning Dialog:
- Create a modal/dialog component that appears when the app first launches
- Include clear warning text about user responsibility
- Implement two buttons:
  - "I Accept Responsibility" (Continue)
  - "I Do Not Accept" (Exit)
- Store user's acceptance in AsyncStorage to avoid showing it every time
- If user clicks "I Do Not Accept", gracefully exit the app

Example Implementation:

Phase 2: App-Specific Tracking and Recording (4-6 weeks)
App Usage Tracking:

Android: Research and implement a way to track app usage using the UsageStatsManager API. You might need to create a native module (Java/Kotlin) to bridge this functionality to React Native.

iOS: The Screen Time API might provide similar functionality on iOS. However, note that direct access to detailed app usage data might be restricted due to Apple's privacy policies. You might need to explore alternative approaches or limit functionality on iOS.

Library: Consider using a cross-platform library like react-native-app-usage (if it meets your requirements and is well-maintained) to abstract away some of the platform-specific complexities.

Permissions:

Implement permission requests for:

Camera access

Microphone access

Storage access

Usage Access permission (Android) or equivalent (iOS)

Use the PermissionsAndroid API in React Native (or react-native-permissions library) and handle permission requests gracefully in the UI.

Screen Recording:

Library: react-native-video

Implementation:

Create a screen recording component using the chosen library.

Configure recording options (resolution, frame rate, etc.).

Use the camera API to obtain the front-facing camera stream and record it simultaneously.

Consider using a library like react-native-ffmpeg to merge the screen and camera recordings into a single video file (this might require native module development).

Timer Logic:

Implement the 2-minute recording every 15 minutes logic using JavaScript's setInterval or a timer library.

Trigger recording start/stop based on this timer and app usage events.

Phase 3: Storage and Playback (3-4 weeks)
Cloud Storage Integration:

Choose a cloud storage provider (Firebase Storage, AWS S3, or Azure Blob Storage).

Set up an account and create a storage bucket.

Install the relevant SDK for your chosen provider in your backend project.

Create API endpoints in your Express backend to handle:

Uploading recorded video files to cloud storage.

Generating secure URLs for playback.

Database Integration:

Choose a database (MongoDB or Firebase Firestore).

Set up your database and create collections/tables for:

Users

App usage data (timestamps, app names, video URLs)

Notification settings

Create backend API endpoints to:

Store app usage and recording data in the database.

Retrieve user-specific data for playback.

Video Playback:

Library: Use the same react-native-video library.

Implementation:

Create a playback screen with a video player component.

Fetch the secure video URL from your backend based on user selection.

Implement sorting and filtering options (by app, timestamp).

Phase 4: Notifications and User Settings (2-3 weeks)
Push Notifications:

Choose a push notification service (FCM or OneSignal).

Integrate the service into your React Native app and backend.

Implement backend logic to send notifications based on app usage and recording events.

Design notification content and link to relevant resources.

User Settings:

Create a settings screen in your app.

Implement a toggle to enable/disable recording.

Add options for users to manage their data (delete recordings, etc.).

Store user preferences in the database.

Phase 5: Testing, Refinement, and Launch (4-6 weeks)
Thorough Testing:

Unit Tests: Write unit tests for individual components and functions (frontend and backend).

Integration Tests: Test the interaction between different parts of your app (e.g., recording, storage, playback).

End-to-End Tests: Test the entire user flow using tools like Detox or Appium.

Platform-Specific Testing: Test on different devices and OS versions.

Performance and Security Testing: Ensure your app is efficient and secure.

Beta Testing:

Release your app to a small group of beta testers.

Collect feedback and address any issues.

Documentation:

Write clear documentation for your code.

Create a user guide or tutorial.

App Store Submission:

Prepare app store assets (screenshots, descriptions, etc.).

Submit your app to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

Important Considerations
Privacy: Be very transparent about data collection and usage. Obtain explicit user consent and follow data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).

Background Execution: Carefully manage background tasks to minimize battery drain. Follow platform guidelines for background execution.

Storage Optimization: Compress video files efficiently to reduce storage costs and improve performance.

Ethical Implications: Consider the potential psychological impact of your app on users. Provide resources and support for users who might experience negative effects.

This roadmap gives you a solid starting point. Remember to be flexible, iterate based on feedback, and adapt your plans as needed throughout the development process! Please let me know if you have any other questions.
